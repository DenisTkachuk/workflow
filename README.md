Optimising Your Front End Workflow
==================================
An example project for the "Optimising Your Front End Workflow" talk first given at the February 2014 Symfony London
meetup.

This project comprises examples of using Twig, Bower and Gulp together in a Symfony 2 project.

Installation
------------
To install this, you need to have Composer, Node, NPM, Bower and Gulp available globally. Then, once cloned:

- `composer install`
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `gulp`

Watching
--------
To play with watching:

```
gulp watch
```

Going Further
-------------
Although all of this works, there are lots of improvements that could be made. If you have any suggestions,
I'd love for us to discuss them!
